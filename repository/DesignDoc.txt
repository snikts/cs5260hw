The Consumer program will contain a class called Consumer, which contains two main functions--createWidget and createTableWidget.
The Consumer will take two mandatory command line arguments and one optional argument. The first argument is the bucket requests
will come from. The second command line argument is the bucket or table name that widgets will be created in. The optional
argument is either "db" or "s3", which tells the consumer if it should write items to a dynamodb table or to an s3 bucket.
The initialize function will parse these command lines and then begin the process of checking for new widget requests. These 
requests will be sent to createWidget if we are writing to a bucket, and createTableWidget if we are writing to a dynamodb
table. These functions will parse the json to fit the parameters of the widget we are writing, and then call a put object function
to write the object appropriately to the resource specified.
